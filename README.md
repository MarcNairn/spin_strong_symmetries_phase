# Phase Strong-Symmetries

This repository contains all scripts to generate the data and figures used in the paper (ArXiv:??/??2025). The code implements the mean field equations of motion as well as the finite size exact diagonalization numerics for permutation-symmetric spin systems. Provided also is a short script to automatically find the strong symmetries tied to any collective two-level system.
